						I've been many times in Rio de Janeiro since I was a kid because part of my family lives there. Every and each time I went to Rio was a whole different experience than the previous times.
						<br/>
						The beaches are incredible and the people are very nice and warm. It's also a very cultural place, and you can find people dancing and singing samba at every corner in the city, and when it's Carnaval everything gets more colorfull and happy.
						<br/>
						<em>*You still need to watch out for you, because in Rio you can get robbed in the streets very easily, specially distracted turists.</em>

						Rome was a nice and fun experience. The first time I was there was for a few hours, at a long connection that I had on my way to Israel.
						<br/>
						I took the train from the airport to the center of the city, and from there I could visit and see all the most famous historical sites in Rome. I went to see the Colosseum, the Trevi Fountain and I had some time to taste a delicious original italian pasta after walking around the city.
						<br/>
						After it, I went back to the airport and had still had a lot of extra time, so I went to city next to the airport called Fiumicino. It's a small city, by the sea.
						<br/>
						Was a geat day afterall.

						Sinai was the last place I visited and is for sure one of my favorites.
						<br/>
						The prices are attractive, but the most special thing of this place is the ocean and all the different reefs and fishes. It feels like another word, all the shapes and colors are special.
						<br/>
						Sinais it's the best place to relax and have some quiet time.
